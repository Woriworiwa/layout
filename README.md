# Layout, a Framer Dopplegagner

This project is an low-code CSS generator built with Angular. It serves several purposes:

- Level up my Angular skills: It's a hands-on learning experience to explore building user-friendly low-code tools.
Experiment with interactivity: The builder serves as a playground to test different ways users can interact with the program.

- UX Experimentation: It's also a playground to experiment with different user interaction methods and user experience design. The goal is to explore innovative ways of interacting with low-code builders, potentially integrating AI, speech recognition, and eye tracking.

- Portfolio Project: This project serves as a practical demonstration of my Angular skills and a showcase for my UX design experience.
