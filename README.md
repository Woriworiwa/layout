# Layout, a Framer Dopplegagner

This project is a low-code CSS generator built with Angular, focused on simplifying the process of creating responsive layouts using Grid and Flexbox. It provides an intuitive interface, reducing the need for manual coding, while showcasing my expertise in front-end development and user experience design.

The primary motivation behind the project is to refine and demonstrate my skills in Angular and CSS. By focusing on these core technologies, I aim to build a practical tool that also serves as a stepping stone in my continuous learning journey. The project explores advanced layout techniques and challenges me to push my understanding of front-end frameworks.

Currently, the project is ongoing, with plans to expand its features, particularly in user interaction. By incorporating AI-driven functionality and speech recognition, the goal is to create more dynamic, accessible experiences. Once fully developed, I plan to add this tool to my portfolio site, showcasing both its practical use and my growth as a developer.
