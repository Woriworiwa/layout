# Layout, a Framer Dopplegagner

This project is a low-code CSS generator built with Angular. It serves several purposes:

- Level up my Angular skills: It's a hands-on learning experience on how easy, or how hard, is to build a low-code app in Angular.

- Level up my CSS skills: It serves as an interactive visual way to experiment and learn CSS layouting techniques. Test out different properties on Grid and Flex layouts in particular.
  
- UX Experimentation: It's also a playground to experiment with different user interaction methods and user experience design. I wish to explore innovative ways of interacting with low-code builders, potentially integrating AI, speech recognition, and eye tracking.

- Portfolio Project: This project serves as a practical demonstration of my Angular skills and a showcase for my UX design experience and lack of UI design taste.
